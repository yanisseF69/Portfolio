    "about": "My name is Yanisse, I am 22 years old and I live in Lyon. My passion for computers and the little algorithmics I did in high school led me to pursue studies in computer science.\n\n\nBeing also passionate about sports, I do running, cycling, and weightlifting. After high school, I even went for a Bachelor's in Sports Science (STAPS), but I stopped after a year because computer science was my true passion.\n\n\nCurrently in the final year of my Master's degree, my thirst for ambition and curiosity are far from diminished! My field of expertise is image processing and medical images. And throughout my studies, I have had numerous experiences both in computer science as a web developer and through all the projects I have completed, as well as in fields such as fast food. This has allowed me to acquire solid skills in communication, teamwork, and autonomy.",
